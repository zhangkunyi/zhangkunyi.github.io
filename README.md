Hello there, I am Kunyi Zhang (张焜怡), currently a Ph.D candidate at [ZJU Fast Lab](http://www.kivact.com/), supervised by Prof. [Fei Gao](https://ustfei.com/) and Prof. [Chao Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/xu). 
During these years, I have been developing visual inertal odometry, LIDAR SLAM, multi sensor fusion for robot autonomous navigation. 

I received my Bachelor's Degree of Engineering from [School of Mechanical and Power Engineering](https://mech.ecust.edu.cn/) and Bachelor's Degree of Science from [School of Mathematics](https://math.ecust.edu.cn/) at [East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST)](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/main.htm) in 2016.
I then started my master's program and a successive doctoral program at [College of Control Science and Engineering (CSE)](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/), [ZheJiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2017. 


I used to work as an intern in the Mapping Group of the Automated Driving Division of Dharma Academy, and now I am also working as an intern in the
I also worked as an intern in the mapping group of  [Autonomous Driving Lab](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/intelligent-transportation/?lang=en) at
[Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) (2022.01-2022.07), and now I am also working as an intern at [Zhejiang Yangtze River Delta Feiyang Intelligent Technology Center](http://iie.zju.edu.cn/) in the Collaborative Technology Department (2020.07-now).
